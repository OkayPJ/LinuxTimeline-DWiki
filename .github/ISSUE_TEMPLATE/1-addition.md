Will be added distributions that have a fullfilled page at the [info archive](https://fabiololix.gitlab.io/) 
and follow the [Timeline direction](https://github.com/FabioLolix/LinuxTimeline/issues/158)

The info archive code is both at:

* https://gitlab.com/FabioLolix/fabiololix.gitlab.io
* https://github.com/FabioLolix/fabiololix.gitlab.io

* The timeline direction can be discussed here: [Timeline direction discussion](https://github.com/FabioLolix/LinuxTimeline/issues/157)
